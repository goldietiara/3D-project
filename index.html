          <h2>👩🏽‍🚀 Spotify-Lite</h2>

          <p>
            I recently embarked on a project to learn Nuxt, a framework based on
            Vue.js. Utilizing Pinia as the store library, I tackled the
            challenge of working with a more complex database. This experience
            broadened my understanding of modern web development and state
            management.

          <h2>👩🏽‍🚀 Twitter-Lite</h2>

          <p>
            Learning more complex database for comments & replied sub-comments,
            making the sub-comments as a new parent. User can now comment
            another sub comments and make them as a new thread/tweet. This logic
            can be implemented using recursion.
